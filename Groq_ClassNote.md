Web architectures have evolved significantly over time, starting from the early days of TCP/IP in the 1960s to the modern web 2.0 and emerging web 3.0. The progression of web architectures has been driven by advancements in technology and the need for more sophisticated and interactive websites.

Web 1.0, which started in the early 1990s, was characterized by basic web pages built using HTML and early forms of Java. The architecture was request and response, with the web browser making a request to a web server and receiving a response back. This architecture was cacheable and indexable, making it easy to access and share information.

The introduction of CGI (Common Gateway Interface) in web 1.0 allowed for the running of scripts, which evolved into mechanisms such as react frameworks. CGI was a significant step forward as it allowed for the running of programs, such as C, on the web server. However, it was not a scalable architecture and had limitations.

Web 2.0, which is the current state of the web, is characterized by high-speed communications, social media, native operating systems on phones, and high-quality videos and pictures. Web 2.0 relies on high-speed communications and the ability to access data quickly from anywhere in the world.

Web 3.0, also known as the semantic web, is still emerging, but examples of it can be seen in NFTs, blockchain, AI, VR, and AR. The web 3.0 standard is not yet adopted, but it is expected to be in the future.

In conclusion, the evolution of web architectures has been driven by the need for more sophisticated and interactive websites. The progression from web 1.0 to web 2.0 and the emerging web 3.0 is a remarkable progression that has been driven by advancements in technology and the need for more sophisticated and interactive websites.
