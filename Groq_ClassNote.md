Class-Note for Exam: Creating Architectures and Best Practices
==============================================================

Introduction
------------

The lecture, given by Greg Boulrice, focused on creating architectures and best practices. The importance of modeling and architecture, as well as the styles and patterns to use, was emphasized. Students were encouraged to interact and share their opinions.

Course Assignments
------------------

-   The first few assignments have been graded. Students should follow the calendar for due dates and are encouraged to work ahead.
-   The next assignment is the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), which should be based on an existing architecture with specific choices or decisions to be made.

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
------------------------------------

-   An ADR is a document outlining a decision between options, such as using Kubernetes or Lambdas, with the logic behind the decision.
-   ADRs should follow an existing architecture and be connected to the architecture being documented and presented.

Web Architectures
----------------

-   The lecture discussed the progression of web architectures, from TCP/IP in the 1960s to the modern-day Internet.
-   The evolution from web 1.0 to web 2.0 and the emerging web 3.0, including the semantic web, AI, VR, and AR, was discussed.

### CT Framework and CGI

-   The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard for transferring information between the World Wide Web and external applications.
-   JavaScript allows for more dynamic web pages by running code on the web browser, shifting some workload from the web server to the client.

Model-View-Controller (MVC) Framework
------------------------------------

-   The MVC framework modularizes code in a web application, with the model representing data, the view being the user interface, and the controller managing communication between the model and the view.

Future Lectures
---------------

-   Future lectures will cover the web 2.0 architecture, the flux pattern, and advancements in web technology since 2005.

Class-Note for Exam: End System / Web Server - Ajax and Web 2.0 Architecture
=======================================================================

1.  Ajax
-------

    -   Ajax allows for updating a segment of a web page without reloading the entire page.
    -   The XmlHttpRequest object communicates asynchronously between the browser and the server, improving user experience.

2.  Web 2.0 Architecture
----------------------

    -   Web 2.0 architecture supports multiple clients, such as mobile apps and IoT devices, and allows for full-featured applications using web protocols.

3.  Web 2.0 Components
--------------------

    -   Web 2.0 architecture consists of a content provider, web browser, Ajax engine, and dynamic application.

4.  Web 2.0 Security
------------------

    -   Web 2.0 introduced web application firewalls (WAF) for security.

5.  Single Page Applications (SPAs)
--------------------------------

    -   SPAs, such as Facebook and Twitter, provide personalized, dynamic content and interactions based on user behavior.

6.  IoT Devices
--------------

    -   IoT devices have become popular with Web 2.0, allowing for the connection of different components using various protocols.

7.  Monetization
---------------

    -   Monetization is a significant driver for the development of Web 2.0 and 3.0 architectures.

8.  Web 3.0
----------

    -   Web 3.0, also known as the semantic web, aims to create more intelligent, interactive, and open web platforms by integrating artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Class-Note:
==========

The evolution of web architecture has been significantly influenced by companies such as Google, Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon. These entities have taken advantage of web 2.0 architecture to provide creative solutions in various sectors, including banking, insurance, and entertainment.

OAuth Model
-----------

-   The OAuth model is a token-based model primarily meant for authorization, and it is more secure, fast, and efficient than previous models.
-   The OAuth model involves several components, including the client, API gateway, API gateway for specific APIs, and an identity provider for authentication and token issuance.

Web 3.0
-------

-   Web 3.0 aims to decentralize communication, trust someone based on component interactions, and remove restrictions of specific software and hardware components.
