Class-Note for Exam: Creating Architectures and Best Practices
==============================================================

Introduction
------------

The lecture, given by Greg Boulrice, focused on creating architectures and best practices. The importance of modeling and architecture, as well as the styles and patterns to use, was emphasized. Students were encouraged to interact and share their opinions.

Course Assignments
------------------

-   The first few assignments have been graded. Students should follow the calendar for due dates and are encouraged to work ahead.
-   The next assignment is the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), which should be based on an existing architecture with specific choices or decisions to be made.

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
------------------------------------

-   An ADR is a document outlining the decision between options, such as using Kubernetes or Lambdas, with the logic behind the decision.
-   ADRs should follow an existing architecture and be connected to the architecture being documented and presented.

Web Architectures
----------------

-   The lecture discussed the progression of web architectures, from TCP/IP in the 1960s to the modern-day Internet.
-   The evolution from web 1.0 to web 2.0 and the emerging web 3.0, including the semantic web, AI, VR, and AR, was discussed.

Best Practices
--------------

-   Clear documentation and communication are essential in creating architectures.
-   Students are encouraged to ask questions and interact during the lecture.
-   Following the calendar for due dates and working ahead is important.
-   Connect ADRs to the architecture being documented and presented.

Class-Note for Exam: End System / Web Server - Ajax and Web 2.0 Architecture
=========================================================================

1. Ajax
-------

-   Ajax allows for updating a segment of a web page without reloading the entire page.
-   It uses the XmlHttpRequest object to communicate asynchronously between the browser and the server.

2. Web 2.0 Architecture
----------------------

-   Web 2.0 allows for full-featured applications using web protocols and supports multiple clients, such as mobile apps and IoT devices.
-   Web 2.0 architecture consists of several components, including a content provider, web browser, Ajax engine, and dynamic application.

3. Web 2.0 Components
--------------------

-   Content providers can distribute content through web servers or content delivery networks (CDNs).
-   The Ajax engine communicates with the server to make requests and receive data, which is then posted to the HTML page.

4. Web 2.0 Security
------------------

-   Web 2.0 introduced web application firewalls (WAF) for security.

5. Single Page Applications (SPAs)
-------------------------------

-   SPAs, such as Facebook and Twitter, provide personalized, dynamic content and interactions based on user behavior.

6. IoT Devices
--------------

-   IoT devices have become popular with Web 2.0, allowing for the connection of different components using various protocols.

7. Monetization
--------------

-   Monetization is a significant driver for the development of Web 2.0 and 3.0 architectures.

8. Web 3.0
----------

-   Web 3.0, also known as the semantic web, aims to create more intelligent, interactive, and open web platforms by integrating artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Class-Note:
==========

The evolution of web architecture has been significantly influenced by companies such as Google, Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon. Web 3.0 aims to decentralize communication, trust someone based on component interactions, and remove restrictions of specific software and hardware components.

OAuth Model
------------

-   The OAuth model is a token-based model primarily meant for authorization.
-   The OAuth model involves several components, including the client, API gateway, API gateway for specific APIs running on web services platforms, and an identity provider for authentication and token issuance.

Cloud-native architectures
--------------------------

-   Cloud-native architectures take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing and use an API gateway to manage access to application features and data.
