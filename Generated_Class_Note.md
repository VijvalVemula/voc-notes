**Note for Authorizing Every Layer**

In the context of Software Architecture, authorizing every layer is crucial to ensure the security and integrity of the system. This lecture highlights the importance of removing restrictions imposed by specific hardware or software components. The focus is on improving the security architecture, particularly in Web 3.0, where blockchain technology plays a significant role.

To understand how authorization works in this context, let's break it down:

1. **Component Interactions**: In traditional systems, multiple components interact with each other to provide a specific service or functionality. This complexity can lead to security vulnerabilities.
2. **Blockchain-based Authorization**: By using blockchain technology, we can create a decentralized system where interactions between components are transparent and secure. This eliminates the need for intermediaries and reduces the risk of tampering.

To illustrate this concept, consider a healthcare company that needs to authorize access to patient data. Traditionally, multiple systems, networks, and software pieces would be involved in this process, making it complex and prone to errors. With blockchain-based authorization, we can create a single, secure platform that ensures authorized access to the data.

**Key Takeaways**

1. Blockchain technology can help simplify complex system interactions by creating a decentralized, secure platform.
2. By removing restrictions imposed by specific hardware or software components, we can improve the overall security architecture.
3. In Web 3.0, blockchain-based authorization is expected to play a significant role in improving security and transparency.
