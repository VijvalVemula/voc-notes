# ADR 5: Data Visualization Tool

## Decision
We will use Tableau for data visualization to provide insights from the processed lecture notes.

## Rationale
Tableau is selected for its powerful visualization capabilities, ease of use, and wide adoption in the industry. It allows non-technical users, such as educators and students, to easily interact with and explore educational data. The decision is based on the need for robust, interactive visualizations that can enhance the educational experience.

## Status
Proposed

## Consequences
Tableau provides high-quality visualizations and interactive dashboards but involves licensing costs. It also necessitates training for users unfamiliar with its interface.
