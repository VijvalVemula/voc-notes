Here is a 1000-word note summarizing the key points discussed in the class lecture on Software Architecture:

**Removing Restrictions and Introducing Trust**

The lecture highlighted the importance of removing restrictions in software architecture, particularly when it comes to component interactions. In traditional Web 2.0 architecture, authorizations are often required from various parties, such as healthcare companies, which can lead to a complex web of interactions involving multiple networks, software pieces, and hardware components.

**Web 3.0 Architecture: Improving Security**

The introduction of blockchain technology in Web 3.0 architecture aims to simplify this complexity by removing the need for specific authorizations from individual parties. This is achieved by treating healthcare back-end systems as a "black box," where interactions are recorded and verified using blockchain technology.

**Benefits of Blockchain**

By leveraging blockchain, software architects can create a more secure and transparent system that eliminates the need for multiple authorizations and reduces the risk of data breaches or tampering. The lecture emphasized that this is not just limited to healthcare systems but has broader implications for various industries.

**Current State and Future Directions**

The lecturer acknowledged that while there are some examples of blockchain adoption in certain industries, more needs to be done to fully realize its potential. They also hinted at the introduction of new concepts and technologies in future lectures, including a focus on data-specific topics.

**Q&A Session**

During the Q&A session, one student asked if it was possible to start working on the firecracker paper without prior knowledge of the lecture material. The lecturer reassured that the paper can be understood standalone, but encouraged students to review the relevant slides and videos first.

**Next Steps and Lab Work**

The lecturer wrapped up the lecture by mentioning the importance of working on the software architecture code for the next lab assignment. They also took this opportunity to remind students that they will be addressing their questions about Spark-related topics in future lectures.

**Closing Remarks**

The lecture concluded with a reminder that students can reach out to the instructor via Discord or email with any further questions or concerns. The lecturer expressed gratitude for the students' attendance and encouraged them to work diligently on their lab assignments, with the next lecture already being planned.
